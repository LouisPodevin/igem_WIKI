                            Phase 2 is <b>killing the target</b> once the chassis has bound to it. For this we looked
                            into bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are <b>antimicrobial peptides</b> (AMP) naturally
                            synthetized by ribosomes and produced by bacteria to help them survive in a highly
                            competitive polymicrobial environment<sup>1</sup>. Bacteriocins are mostly synthetized by
                            Gram positive bacteria such as Lactic Acid Bacteria but Gram negatives can also secrete some
                            types of peptides. The first bacteriocin was identified in 1925<sup>2</sup>.

                            Interesting characteristics about bacteriocins that comforted our choice in using them for
                            our project is that they are considered as
                            <b>non-harmful for human</b> use as they are easily degraded by proteolytic enzymes and can
                            target specific pathogens in contrary to antibiotics so they do not have an impact on the
                            commensal flora, however there are some eventual exceptions<sup>1</sup>.

                            Research on bacteriocins to fight against human pathogens exists but most of the time they
                            are <b>combined with drugs</b>. For example, the well-known antibiotic resistant-pathogenic
                            <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> which, according to the Centers for Disease Control and

                            of concept, we need to choose a bacteriocin that can
                            <b>kill the target but not the host</b>. There are many different types of bacteriocins with

                            The <b>initial goal</b> was to
                            <b>link the physical binding of the LTF to the target with the secretion of AMP</b>.
                            Meaning, the expression of the AMP would be induced once the bacteria bound. We looked into
                            shear stress (since there could be a mechanical signal when the LTF was bound),
                            reengineering two component systems etc. What was <b>difficult</b> was that the LTF was
                            linked to the outer membrane via Lpp-OmpA and that nothing could be expressed upstream of
                            the Lpp without affecting its outer membrane signaling function that we needed.

                            After months of intense research and brainstorming on this concept we concluded that with
                            the remaining time we had, our initial objective could not be completed: The expression of
                            AMP had to be <b>constitutive</b> and it had to be controlled in a way that it would only
                            affect the target strain once the chassis is nearby. With that in mind, we found a microcin
                            called <b>MccPDI</b> (Proximity Dependent Inhibition) which was first identified in 2009<sup

                            and requires close <b>physical proximity</b> between the producer and susceptible strains.
                            MccPDI has a <b>narrow spectrum</b> and can kill several strains of <b><i>E. coli</i></b

                            commensal strains such as <i>E. coli</i> K12<sup>3</sup>3. It has also been shown that
                            Shigella is sensitive to MccPDI<sup>4</sup>. It recognizes specific Outer Membrane Protein F
                            motifs on the target and leads to <b>lethal membrane damage</b>. The MccPDI gene cluster was
                            initially identified in the strain <i>E. coli</i> 25 plasmid<sup>4</sup>. It is a locus of
                            approximately 4.8kb and is composed of 5 genes which are each necessary for the appropriate

                                The proximity dependent inhibition characteristic of the microcin we will be using is
                                still under investigation. Since it is currently thought that the
                                <b>inhibition is linked to a concentration</b> of microcin, our goal is to try to
                                respect the concentration initially produced by the <i>E. coli</i> 25 strain for this
                                proof of concept. However, the MccPDI gene cluster originally found in <i>E. coli</i> 25
                                is not constitutive and is
                                <b>controlled by the EnvZ/OmpR Two Component System</b> (TCS). In fact, knockout mutants
                                of the TCS did not show a PDI+phenotype<sup>5</sup>. EnvZ is an osmotic sensor which
                                upregulates the phosphorylation of OmpR (a transcription factor) which binds to the
                                promoter region upstream of McpM, McpI and McpA. It was shown that the production of
                                <b>MccPDI was higher in M9 medium</b>
                                compared to LB medium. Furthermore, mcpD and mcpB are under the influence of another
                                transcriptional regulation.

                                this, a sensitive strain is plated (<i>E. coli</i> DH5α or BL21) and disks are
                                inoculated with different bacterial cultures. The positive control is

                                as the microcin is secreted and kills the surrounding cells. This control will be

                                As mentioned in phase 1, we are developing a <b>software</b> that will design the
                                BioBrick with the key LTF gene part according to the target. Since the overall project
                                aims at killing the target, we could look into <b>integrating an AMP database</b> to the
                                software as well if keep this killing method in the future. The goal is to have a
                                tailor-made system that can be easily modified according to the target bacterium. With
                                this in mind, we came across an article published by Geldart et al.<sup>8</sup> in 2016
                                containing preliminary data on a <b>microcin secretion system</b> which could be
                                <b>universal</b>. This means that the secretion system would always be the same (the
                                microcin V system) and only the coding sequence of the AMP would have to be replaced.
                                Furthermore, certain bacteriocins have been identified to <b>fight against biofilms</b>.
                                For example, <b>Microcin S</b> initially produced by probiotic strain
                                <i>E. coli</i> G3/10 manages to inhibit the adherence of enteropathogenic strains of
                                <i>E. coli</i><sup>9</sup>. Since antibiotic strains tend to increase their resistance
                                and survive by forming biofilms, it would be interesting to <b>combine</b> the secretion
                                of AMPs to this type of bacteriocin. A limit regarding bacteriocins is that some
                                resistance can occur when there is a continuous exposure. For example, it was shown that
                                a degrading enzyme exists for one of the most famous bacteriocins called Nisin
                                (nisinase).

                            <p>
                                This issue can be solved by
                                <b>secreting a few AMPs at a time</b>. Indeed, we found a study showing that resistance
                                to individual colicins occurs after 9 hours of treatment but when
                                <b>5 colicins are combined</b>, no resistance occurs<sup>10</sup>. Thus, the next step
                                of this phase would be to manage to secrete at least 3 antimicrobial peptides at a time
                                but maintain the specificity of our system. As AMPs are very sensitive to proteolytic
                                enzymes, <b>oral administration</b> often results in peptide degradation. It is
                                necessary to find a way to administer the bacteria to the site of infection which is
                                most of the time found inside the <b>Gastrointestinal Tract</b>. This is the
                                <b>fourth phase</b> of the project which will be discussed further on.
